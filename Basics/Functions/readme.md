# Steps to Start Competitive Programming

## 1. Learn the Basics of DSA
Before diving into CP, ensure you are comfortable with:

- **Basic Programming**: Loops, conditionals, functions
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Understanding Big-O notation
- **Important Data Structures**: Arrays, Strings, HashMaps, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
- **Common Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)

## 2. Choose a CP Platform
Here are some of the best websites for CP practice:

### âœ… Beginner-Friendly Platforms
- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** â€“ Great for coding interview preparation with structured problem sets.
- **[GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)** â€“ Covers theory + practice questions with detailed explanations.
- **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)** â€“ Good for learning algorithms step by step.

### ðŸ”¥ Best for Competitive Programming
- **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)** â€“ Best for regular contests and improving problem-solving skills.
- **[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)** â€“ Hosts monthly contests and beginner-friendly practice problems.
- **[AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)** â€“ A Japanese platform with well-organized contests.
- **[TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)** â€“ One of the oldest CP platforms.
- **[CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/)** â€“ Offers well-structured problems with explanations.

## 3. Start Solving Problems
- **Beginner**: Solve problems with ratings of **800-1200** (on Codeforces) or **Easy/Medium** problems on LeetCode.
- **Intermediate**: Move to **1300-1800** rating problems and practice **Graph & DP** problems.
- **Advanced**: Solve **1900+ rating** problems and participate in contests regularly.

## 4. Participate in Contests Regularly
- Join **weekly contests** on Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef, or LeetCode.
- Start with **Div 4 & Div 3** contests on Codeforces, then gradually move up.
- Try **Google Kick Start**, **Facebook Hacker Cup**, and **ICPC** (if eligible).

## 5. Learn Advanced Techniques
Once comfortable, explore:

- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Advanced DP**
- **Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees**
- **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra, Floyd Warshall, MST)
- **Game Theory**
- **Number Theory & Combinatorics**

## 6. Optimize Speed & Debugging
- Use **C++ (fastest), Python (easy), or Java**.
- Master **STL (C++)** and **collections (Java/Python)**.
- Learn **debugging tricks** and **efficient I/O handling**.

## 7. Join a CP Community
- **Codeforces Blogs & Editorials**
- **Discord & Telegram CP Groups**
- **YouTube CP Channels** (Errichto, William Lin, NeetCode, Striver, CodeNCode)
